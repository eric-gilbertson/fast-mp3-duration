# Fast MP3 Duration

This project demonstrates how to quickly read the time duration of an MP3 file using
client side javascript. This is accomplished by modifying the MP3 scanning code from 
the ddsol/mp3-duration so that it can run directly in the browser. Using this scheme the
duration for a 200MB audio file can be obtained in approximately two seconds.
